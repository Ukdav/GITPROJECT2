**WHAT IS GIT?**

Git is a distributed version control system designed to track changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project efficiently, keeping track of changes, managing versions, and enabling easy collaboration.

**Here are some key concepts and features of Git:**

**Version Control System:**

Git tracks changes to files over time, allowing you to revert to previous versions, compare changes, and collaborate effectively with others.

**Distributed:**

Unlike centralized version control systems, Git is distributed. Each developer has a complete copy of the repository, which makes branching, merging, and working offline much easier.

**Repositories:**

A Git repository is a collection of files, their history, and the configuration data needed to manage them. It stores all versions of files and their metadata.

**Commits:**

A commit represents a snapshot of the changes made to the repository at a specific point in time. Each commit has a unique identifier and includes a message explaining the changes made.

**Branches:**

Git allows you to create branches, which are independent lines of development. This feature enables you to work on different features or bug fixes simultaneously.

**Merging:**

Merging combines changes from one branch into another. Git automatically handles merging whenever you integrate changes from one branch into another.

**Pull Requests:**

Pull requests (PRs) are a way to propose changes to a repository. They allow collaborators to review, discuss, and approve the changes before they are merged.

**Remote Repositories:**

Git supports remote repositories hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. Developers can push their changes to remote repositories and pull changes made by others.

**Clone:**

Cloning creates a copy of a remote repository on your local machine. This allows you to work on the project locally and push your changes back to the remote repository.

**Push and Pull:**

Pushing involves sending your local changes to a remote repository, while pulling involves fetching changes from a remote repository to update your local copy.

**Conflict Resolution:**

Git helps manage conflicts that can arise when multiple developers modify the same file. It provides tools to resolve these conflicts manually.

Git is widely used in the software development industry due to its flexibility, speed, and powerful branching and merging capabilities. It helps teams manage complex projects efficiently and maintain a history of changes, making collaboration and tracking progress easier.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to initialize a repository and make a commit using Git Bash:

**Install Git Bash (if not already installed):**

If you haven't already, download and install Git Bash from the official Git website: https://git-scm.com/downloads

**Open Git Bash:**

Once installed, open Git Bash. You'll be working with a command-line interface.

Navigate to Your Project Directory:

On your terminal, create a working folder or directory e.g DevOps using this command **Mkdir DevOps**

Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where you want to create your Git repository. For example: **cd DevOps**

while you are inside the folder, run this command: **git init**

![mkdir   cd   git init](https://github.com/Ukdav/GITPROJECT2/assets/139593350/b74b837f-f31a-40d8-bd66-cbad10fb3581)
